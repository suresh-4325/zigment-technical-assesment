First STep in vs code
npx create-react-app dynamic-form --template typescript
cd dynamic-form
npm install react-hook-form tailwindcss @playwright/test @testing-library/react jest
npx tailwindcss init


Second STEP:-

You will need to configure Tailwind CSS and Jest:

2.1. tailwind.config.js This file configures Tailwind CSS.

js
Copy code
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};




Third Step :-

postcss.config.js This is used to integrate Tailwind with PostCSS (created automatically if you run npx tailwindcss init).

js
Copy code
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
};




Fourth Step :-

2.3. src/index.css This file imports Tailwind CSS styles.

css
Copy code
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;  




Fifth Step :- 
3. Core Files
You will need a few core files for your components and app structure:

3.1. src/App.tsx file which i gave to u 
This is the main component where the DynamicForm component is used and the schema is defined







Sixth Step :-
3.2. src/components/DynamicForm.tsx   now import this file.
This file contains the form component that renders dynamically based on the JSON schema..




Run Program :- Run the Application:
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start

Check the form in the browser: You will see the dynamically generated form based on the JSON schema, complete with validations and different input types.
